# j5mclaunch
## Bare minimum Minecraft launcher

j5mclaunch was made so I could launch older versions of the game on a Java 5 system (like a PowerPC mac)

### This REQUIRES a newer version of CURL to be installed than what TigerBrew installs by default. It needs a version of OpenSSL with TLS 1.3

Fallback doesn't work with old versions of Java so its important CURL is present!
