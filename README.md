# j5mclaunch
## Bare minimum Minecraft launcher

j5mclaunch was made so I could launch older versions of the game on a Java 5 system (like a PowerPC mac) but it hasn't reached that state yet. It works as a launcher but still relies on Java's internal networking on all platforms. My end goal is to use OpenSSL and cURL and only rely on Java networking as a fallback
